# Open positions

**Note: We currently don't have funding for additional PhD and postdoc positions. We can only welcome you if you have a fellowship. I'd be happy to support you after you apply to our group. If you have additional questions, please email Dr. Solodkin.**


<!-- We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit! -->

 
### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions

If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:solodkin@utdallas.edu). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, note this in your email.


### Master/Bsc students
If you are a Master student at UT Dallas looking for a Master project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.


### Bsc / Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at UT Dallas, see [UTD BBS degree](https://bbs.utdallas.edu/degrees/). Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).
